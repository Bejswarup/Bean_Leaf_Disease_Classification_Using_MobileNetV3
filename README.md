# Bean_Leaf_Disease_Classification_Using_MobileNetV3
The goal of this project is to build a machine learning model that can help bean farmers, mainly in Africa, detect bean leaves with defects early enough.
There are two common bean diseases that significantly decrease yields. They are: Angular Leaf Spot and Bean Rust.

Angular Leaf Spot Angular leaf spot (ALS) is a serious disease caused by the fungus Phaeoisariopsis griseola. Angular leaf spot lesions are most common on leaves and appear as gray or brown irregular spots surrounded by a chlorotic halo. The reduction in yield caused by ALS is primarily due to a decrease in photosynthetic area; however, the fungal pathogen can also reduce quality by causing lesions on pods. Reference.

Bean rust Bean rust is also a fungus infection caused by Uromyces appendiculatus. The disease occurs sporadically and is only significant during prolonged periods of warm, moist weather. Symptoms appear on leaves and pods as pustules of red-brown powdery spores (urediniospores) that rupture the outer layer. They are frequently surrounded by a yellow halo. This infection can cause defoliation, which causes the leaves to lose photosynthesis, resulting in decreased vigor and yield. Reference.

The good news, however, is that if these diseases are spotted early enough, they can be controlled and treated with some specially formulated fungicides and pesticides.
